# Series A Sabotage - Design Notes

## Origin
The idea started from thinking about Meta's alleged billion dollar pay packages to top AI researchers. The original concept was "how long could you afford them?" A runway calculator with absurd salaries. But it evolved into something more fun that could work across a wider range of audiences—a roster of famous personas and pop culture characters that let you build a ridiculous dream team.

## The hero is the product
I wanted the Warp headcount planner to become the hero of the story. There are three entry points where Warp steps in:

1. **Runway hits zero**: When the clock runs out, Warp offers to help you model a real team under real constraints so that your startup's clock doesn't run out in real life.
2. **After a roast**: If you get your team roasted and it's a disaster, Warp shows up with "Make sure you don't end up like this team" and a path to plan something better.
3. **After praise**: If your team gets praised, Warp says "Build a team that actually works this well" and helps you turn the fantasy into a real hiring plan.

## Easter eggs
Part of the fun was hiding moments that reward exploration:
- **Audio quotes**: Certain team members have voice lines that play when you add them. Tim Cook says "Good Morning," Edna Mode shouts "NO CAPES!", Kim tells you to get up and work, etc.
- **The Snoop Dogg experience**: Adding Snoop triggers a full takeover. The screen fills with floating Snoops, his avatar spins to the center, and "Drop It Like It's Hot" starts playing.

## Next steps
- Find more personas to round out the roster and cover more archetypes.
- Tighten the copy throughout, especially the buffs/debuffs and team analysis.
- Test share links across more platforms.
- Turning it into a two-step process: set up personas and then a game simulation for what you could achieve with this roster in the time you can afford them.
- Create more easter eggs like the Snoop Dogg experience.
